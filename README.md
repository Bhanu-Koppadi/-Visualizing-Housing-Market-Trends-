# üè° Visualizing Housing Market Trends: An Analysis of Sale Prices and Features Using Tableau

This project, built for ABC Company, focuses on uncovering patterns in housing sales and renovation trends by leveraging Tableau dashboards and analytical storytelling. With a structured approach and a cleaned dataset of over 21,000 housing records, we dive deep into what influences house prices and how certain property characteristics evolve over time.

## üìä Project Overview

The real estate market is complex ‚Äî driven by factors like renovations, structural features, age, and trends. This project aims to give ABC Company clear insights into:

- üí∞ How recent renovations impact sale prices  
- üè† Age-wise distribution of houses by structural features (bathrooms, floors, bedrooms)  
- üìà Sales performance segmented by renovation periods  
- üÜö Comparison of renovated vs. non-renovated homes by house age groups  

To accomplish this, we performed the following:

- ‚úÖ Cleaned and transformed the dataset using Python  
- üìä Built **4 Tableau visualizations** focused on KPIs, structure, and sales  
- üéûÔ∏è Delivered **1 complete Tableau Story** presenting business insights  
- üîÑ Used pivoting and grouping techniques for visual clarity
